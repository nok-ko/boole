## What is this?

This is a tool I developed while in a discrete mathematics course, learning about Boolean algebra. (Hence the name.)

It uses a funky Regex to turn a certain form of Boolean expression into a truth table.

Also, it supports backreferences between table columns, which is a little bit cool.

## How to use it

1. Type your expression in the text input field. Use single-letter variable names, mash them together to do an AND, put a plus between two (optionally) AND-ed terms to do an OR, and put an `'` (apostrophe) after a variable to NOT it.
2. Press Enter to write your expression into a column in the table
3. Repeat until you understand whatever expression you're working on.

I used this little extensively during a unit on proving that one Boolean expression is equivalent to another, it helped me spot mistakes. Hopefully it can help you, too! ðŸ’™
